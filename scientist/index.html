            <p>Marie Curie became the first woman to win the
                 Nobel Prize and the first person to win it twice.
                  Her efforts led to the development of nuclear
                 energy and Radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer.</p>

            <p>Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he 
                proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete 
                and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the 
                atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although 
                the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid.</p>

            <p>Albert Einstein 14 March 1879  18 April 1955 was a German-born theoretical 
                physicist who is widely held as one of the most influential scientists. 
                Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important 
                contributions to quantum mechanics.His mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2, 
                which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".</p>

            <p>Francesco Redi 18 February 1626 1 March 1697 was an Italian physician, 
                naturalist, biologist, and poet. 
                He is referred to as the "founder of experimental biology",[2][3] and as the "father of modern parasitology".[4][5] He was the 
                first person to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies.
                Having a doctoral degree in both medicine and philosophy from the University of Pisa at the age of 21, he worked in various cities of Italy.</p>
